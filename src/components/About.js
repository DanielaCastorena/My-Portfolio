  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Daniela Castorena</strong>, an aspiring front-end developer based in Reno, Nevada. I am passionate about crafting interactive and responsive web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recently graduated from the <strong>University of Nevada, Reno</strong> with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. My journey into computer science began in high school, where guest speakers introduced us to coding games during math classes. Although my school didn't offer computer science courses at the time, I shared my enthusiasm with my AP Calculus teacher. She encouraged me to apply for the CREATE program at UNR, which stands for "Creating Retention and Engagement for Academically Talented Engineers." This National Science Foundation-funded scholarship program supports promising engineering students through financial aid, academic resources, and professional development opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, I have developed proficiency in technologies such as React, JavaScript, and CSS. I thrive on building projects that address real-world challenges while maintaining clean, efficient code and ensuring responsive design and accessibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe in the transformative power of technology to create meaningful experiences, and I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and tools. Learning is a lifelong journey, and I recognize that there’s always more to discover in my career.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m eager to collaborate and explore new opportunities. Feel free to browse my projects or reach out—I’d love to connect!
